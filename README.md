# FAC-Mindfulness-Generator

The idea for this side-project came to me when I noticed a fellow member of the FAC discord chat had created a live countdown timer for the application deadline. They also shared a valuable resource - a link to a live YouTube channel that plays ambient music to help with coding focus.

## What I Made
Inspired by this, I decided to contribute something helpful to the FAC (Founders and Coders) community during their application process. As someone who practices mindfulness regularly, I came up with the idea of creating a Mindfulness Quotes Generator. The aim was to provide users with random mindfulness quotes to inspire and encourage them during their coding journey.

## Why I Made It
I wanted to offer a tool that could promote a positive and mindful mindset among the FAC community. Mindfulness can help reduce stress, increase focus, and improve overall well-being. By incorporating mindfulness quotes into the application process, I hoped to create a supportive and uplifting environment for applicants.

## How I Made It
To begin, I implemented some basic styling and strategically used div elements to structure the text area, a box, and a button. My plan was to program the button to generate a new random mindfulness quote in the text area each time it was pressed.
